# auto-GPT-js
Port from python to typescript

This was more of an experiment/exercise than a true attempt to create a sister project to Auto-GPT. 

I dont know Python, so I worked with ChatGPT (gpt-4) to port each file to rough parity and then I went through and manually resolved the issues. 

This port is working against the Auto-GPT codebase as of roughly [this commit](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/84c128fd0facca6a4f27c52a1032656d97abfc72]. There's been nearly double the commits added since then (2 days ago, atm), so it's missing some of the improved architecture.
